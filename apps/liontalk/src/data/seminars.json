        "abstract": "Computational difficulty of quadratic matching and the Gromov-Wasserstein distance has led to various approximation and relaxation schemes. One of such methods, relying on the notion of distance profiles, has been widely used in practice, but its theoretical understanding is limited. By delving into the statistical complexity of the previously proposed method based on distance profiles, we show that it suffers from the curse of dimensionality unless we make certain assumptions on the underlying metric measure spaces. Building on this insight, we propose and analyze a modified matching procedure that can be used to robustly match points under a certain probabilistic setting. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods using simulations and real data applications to complement the theoretical findings. As a result, we contribute to the literature by providing theoretical underpinnings of the matching procedures based on distance invariants like distance profiles, which have been widely used in practice but rarely analyzed theoretically.",

        "abstract": "We propose a framework to construct practical kernel-based two-sample tests from the family of f-divergences. The test statistic is computed from the witness function of a regularized variational representation of the divergence, which we estimate using kernel methods. The proposed test is adaptive over hyperparameters such as the kernel bandwidth and the regularization parameter. We provide theoretical guarantees for statistical test power across our family of f-divergence estimates. While our test covers a variety of f-divergences, we bring particular focus to the Hockey-Stick divergence, motivated by its applications to differential privacy auditing and machine unlearning evaluation. For two-sample testing, experiments demonstrate that different f-divergences are sensitive to different localized differences, illustrating the importance of leveraging diverse statistics. For machine unlearning, we propose a relative test that distinguishes true unlearning failures from safe distributional variations.",

        "abstract": "Imagine an investor who owns a stock that he wishes to sell so as to maximize his return and minimize his risk upon selling. In line with the classic mean-variance analysis, we identify the return with the expectation of the stock price and the risk with the variance of the stock price.\nThe quadratic nonlinearity of the variance then moves the resulting optimal stopping problem outside the scope of the standard/linear optimal stopping theory. Consequently, the results and methods of the standard/linear optimal stopping theory are no longer applicable in this new/nonlinear setting.\nThe solution to the nonlinear problem when the horizon is infinite has been known for some time, however, the method of proof used to solve the nonlinear problem in that case is not applicable in the case when the horizon is finite. The purpose of the talk is to present a new method of proof which solves the nonlinear problem when the horizon is finite. [This is joint work with P. Johnson and J.L. Pedersen]",

We provide general robustness conditions that guarantee the well-posedness of physical solutions to the dynamics, and demonstrate their connections to the dynamic percolation theory. We then study the limiting behavior of the particle systems, establishing the continuous dependence of the joint law of the physical solution on the underlying graph structure with respect to local convergence and showing the convergence of the global empirical measure, which extends the general results by Lacker et al. to systems with singular interaction. The model proposed provides a general framework for analyzing systemic risks in large sparsely connected financial networks with a focus on local interactions, featuring instantaneous default cascades.

Our approach is based on the construction of a Snell envelope under a sublinear expectation. We prove a duality formula for the robust superhedging price and establish the existence of a minimal superhedging strategy. Our results encompass continuous processes or processes with jumps and non-vanishing diffusion. A key application is to financial market models, where uncertainty is quantified through the semi-martingale characteristics.",

In a large-scale experiment, we show that providing voters information about candidates\u2019 criminal charges increases votes for clean candidates and reduces votes for criminal politicians, with larger penalties for candidates facing more and serious charges. A follow-up experiment replicates these results and identifies two mechanisms. First, information facilitates learning: voters form more accurate beliefs and evaluate criminal candidates less favorably. Second, using direct measures of voter attention, we show that information makes criminality more salient\u2014especially when it is surprising or highlights contrast\u2014and increases its weight in voting decisions. Our findings demonstrate that information can improve political selection in polarized environments by helping voters learn about, and drawing their attention to, valence qualities.",
