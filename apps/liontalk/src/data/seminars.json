        "abstract": "Computational difficulty of quadratic matching and the Gromov-Wasserstein distance has led to various approximation and relaxation schemes. One of such methods, relying on the notion of distance profiles, has been widely used in practice, but its theoretical understanding is limited. By delving into the statistical complexity of the previously proposed method based on distance profiles, we show that it suffers from the curse of dimensionality unless we make certain assumptions on the underlying metric measure spaces. Building on this insight, we propose and analyze a modified matching procedure that can be used to robustly match points under a certain probabilistic setting. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods using simulations and real data applications to complement the theoretical findings. As a result, we contribute to the literature by providing theoretical underpinnings of the matching procedures based on distance invariants like distance profiles, which have been widely used in practice but rarely analyzed theoretically.",

        "abstract": "We propose a framework to construct practical kernel-based two-sample tests from the family of f-divergences. The test statistic is computed from the witness function of a regularized variational representation of the divergence, which we estimate using kernel methods. The proposed test is adaptive over hyperparameters such as the kernel bandwidth and the regularization parameter. We provide theoretical guarantees for statistical test power across our family of f-divergence estimates. While our test covers a variety of f-divergences, we bring particular focus to the Hockey-Stick divergence, motivated by its applications to differential privacy auditing and machine unlearning evaluation. For two-sample testing, experiments demonstrate that different f-divergences are sensitive to different localized differences, illustrating the importance of leveraging diverse statistics. For machine unlearning, we propose a relative test that distinguishes true unlearning failures from safe distributional variations.",

        "abstract": "How does probability theory apply to statistical practice? Not just through the usual limit theorems of fixed-model asymptotics. Probability theory also has interesting and important challenges related to models of growing complexity. Solving some of these probability problems should allow us to fit more accurate models and make better predictions and inferences in the real world. We motivate and explain several of these open problems: piranha theorems, incoherent Gibbs sampling, the martingale property of probability forecasts, predictively consistent priors, and infill or sprawl asymptotics.",

        "abstract": "Despite growing attention to local policies governing public safety issues, and mounting reports of police union spending to local candidates, the role of police unions in local politics remains understudied. We address this gap by assembling a novel, large-scale dataset on campaign finance in U.S. mayoral elections, covering 2,303 races across 1,073 cities from 2001 to 2019. We document that police unions frequently donate to mayoral candidates\u2014especially in mid-sized and large cities\u2014targeting likely winners and incumbents, and without displaying clear partisan bias. Using a within-city design that accounts for heterogeneous treatment effects in presence of staggered treatment timing, we find that the election of a police union\u2013backed mayor leads to an expansion in police department size. However, we do not find improvements in police performance in these cities, suggesting that unions\u2019 political involvement, while providing additional resources, might also be associated with reduced incentives for effort.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines how buyer counterparty risk -arising from the possibility that buyers renegotiate long-term contracts under the threat of default- distorts market efficiency. We develop a theoretical model showing that the prospect of renegotiation raises contract prices, further increasing the likelihood of renegotiation, and depresses investment. We then assess several policy interventions to promote contract liquidity in the presence of buyer counterparty risk, including public subsidies, financial guarantees, and collateral requirements. While these tools can mitigate price distortions and stimulate investment, they also introduce trade-offs, such as moral hazard and reliance on costly public funds. These insights are particularly relevant in sectors with capital-intensive, long-lived assets exposed to price volatility, notably electricity markets, where underinvestment in renewable generation may slow the energy transition and hinder decarbonization goals. Finally, we simulate the Spanish electricity contract market to quantify the model\u2019s predictions.",
