        "abstract": "Computational difficulty of quadratic matching and the Gromov-Wasserstein distance has led to various approximation and relaxation schemes. One of such methods, relying on the notion of distance profiles, has been widely used in practice, but its theoretical understanding is limited. By delving into the statistical complexity of the previously proposed method based on distance profiles, we show that it suffers from the curse of dimensionality unless we make certain assumptions on the underlying metric measure spaces. Building on this insight, we propose and analyze a modified matching procedure that can be used to robustly match points under a certain probabilistic setting. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods using simulations and real data applications to complement the theoretical findings. As a result, we contribute to the literature by providing theoretical underpinnings of the matching procedures based on distance invariants like distance profiles, which have been widely used in practice but rarely analyzed theoretically.",

        "abstract": "We propose a framework to construct practical kernel-based two-sample tests from the family of f-divergences. The test statistic is computed from the witness function of a regularized variational representation of the divergence, which we estimate using kernel methods. The proposed test is adaptive over hyperparameters such as the kernel bandwidth and the regularization parameter. We provide theoretical guarantees for statistical test power across our family of f-divergence estimates. While our test covers a variety of f-divergences, we bring particular focus to the Hockey-Stick divergence, motivated by its applications to differential privacy auditing and machine unlearning evaluation. For two-sample testing, experiments demonstrate that different f-divergences are sensitive to different localized differences, illustrating the importance of leveraging diverse statistics. For machine unlearning, we propose a relative test that distinguishes true unlearning failures from safe distributional variations.",

        "abstract": "How does probability theory apply to statistical practice? Not just through the usual limit theorems of fixed-model asymptotics. Probability theory also has interesting and important challenges related to models of growing complexity. Solving some of these probability problems should allow us to fit more accurate models and make better predictions and inferences in the real world. We motivate and explain several of these open problems: piranha theorems, incoherent Gibbs sampling, the martingale property of probability forecasts, predictively consistent priors, and infill or sprawl asymptotics. Here are some references that start to address these topics: https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/piranha_published.pdf https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/arnold2.pdf https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/mi_theory9.pdf https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/09/24/its-martingale-time-baby-how-to-evaluate-probabilistic-forecasts-before-the-event-happens-rajiv-sethi-has-an-idea-hint-it-involves-time-series/ https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11833 https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2013/05/30/infill-asymptotics-and-sprawl-asymptotics/",

        "abstract": "Multi-view pose estimation is essential for quantifying animal behavior in scientific research, yet current methods struggle to achieve accurate tracking with limited labeled data and suffer from poor uncertainty estimates. We address these challenges with a comprehensive framework combining novel training and post-processing techniques, and a model distillation procedure that leverages the strengths of these techniques to produce a more efficient and effective pose estimator. Our multi-view transformer (MVT) utilizes pretrained backbones and enables simultaneous processing of information across all views, while a novel patch masking scheme learns robust cross-view correspondences without camera calibration. For calibrated setups, we incorporate geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and a triangulation loss. We extend the existing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor to the nonlinear case and enhance uncertainty quantification via a variance inflation technique. Finally, to leverage the scaling properties of the MVT, we design a distillation procedure that exploits improved EKS predictions and uncertainty estimates to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby reducing dependence on manual labels. Our framework components consistently outperform existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees), with each component contributing complementary benefits. The result is a practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.",

In line with the classic mean-variance analysis, we identify the return with the expectation of the stock price and the risk with the variance of the stock price.\nThe quadratic nonlinearity of the variance then moves the resulting optimal stopping problem outside the scope of the standard/linear optimal stopping theory. Consequently, the results and methods of the standard/linear optimal stopping theory are no longer applicable in this new/nonlinear setting.\nThe solution to the nonlinear problem when the horizon is infinite has been known for some time, however, the method of proof used to solve the nonlinear problem in that case is not applicable in the case when the horizon is finite. The purpose of the talk is to present a new method of proof which solves the nonlinear problem when the horizon is finite. [This is joint work with P. Johnson and J.L. Pedersen]",

We then study the limiting behavior of the particle systems, establishing the continuous dependence of the joint law of the physical solution on the underlying graph structure with respect to local convergence and showing the convergence of the global empirical measure, which extends the general results by Lacker et al. to systems with singular interaction. The model proposed provides a general framework for analyzing systemic risks in large sparsely connected financial networks with a focus on local interactions, featuring instantaneous default cascades.

        "abstract": "Carbon-footprint labeling has emerged as a prominent tool to shift consumers towards lower- emissions choices, but its effectiveness remains unclear, especially in polarized settings like the US. We report on the first large-scale evaluation of carbon labeling\u2014a randomized field experiment with over 230,000 customers of a major food company. Carbon-footprint labels yielded modest average emission reductions of 0.6% but caused backlash: customers opposed to environmental nudges increased their dietary emissions. Despite limited environmental impact, the labels had positive financial returns, increasing customer retention by 1.0% and average customer-week profits by 0.9%. Thus, while climate labels will likely remain a popular sustainability nudge, they have only small environmental benefits and may backfire in polarized settings.",
