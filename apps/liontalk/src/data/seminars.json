        "abstract": "Algorithmic stability is a central concept in statistics and learning theory that measures how sensitive an algorithm's output is to small changes in the training data. In this talk, we consider two different perspectives of algorithmic stability in statistical inference. In the first part, we investigate the problem of distribution-free algorithm risk evaluation, uncovering fundamental limitations for answering these questions with limited amounts of data. To navigate the challenge, we will discuss how incorporating an assumption about algorithmic stability might help. In this second part, we reveal that while stability entails desirable properties, it is typically not sufficient on its own for statistical learning. For example, an algorithm that always outputs a constant function is perfectly stable but statistically meaningless. Then we will discuss the trade-offs between stability and accuracy in statistical inference.",
        "bio": "Yuetian Luo is an assistant professor in the Department of Statistics at Rutgers University. Before that, he was a postdoctoral scholar in the Data Science Institute at the University of Chicago, advised by Professor Rina Foygel Barber. He received his Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2022 under the supervision of Professor Anru Zhang. His research interests lie broadly in distribution-free inference, computational complexity of statistical inference, tensor learning, robust statistics, and non-convex optimization."

Interestingly, metaheuristics seem to be still relatively underused in the statistical research community. I present an overview of nature-inspired metaheuristics and describe their main appealing features, which are their speed, flexibility, availability of codes in different platforms, and ease of implementation and usage.\nAbove all, they are virtually assumption-free, enabling us to apply these general-purpose algorithms to tackle all kinds of high-dimensional optimization tasks. I will highlight recent applications of these algorithms to find theory-based early-phase clinical trials, that are more realistic and flexible than current designs.\nIf time permits, I will use an exemplary nature-inspired algorithm, called Particle Swarm Optimization and demonstrate how it quickly finds an optimal design for estimating a dose that optimizes a clinical utility index under a Bivariate Emax Model.\nKeywords: Continuous Designs, Early Phase Trials, Equivalence Theorems,\nOptimal Experiment Designs, Particle Swarm Optimization.",
        "bio": "Professor Wong is a Professor at UCLA since 1990 and over the years, he has done collaborative work in dentistry, environment health science, rheumatology, and various domains in oncology, including in the design and analysis of cancer control and prevention trials for controlling Hepatitis B among Asians, colorectal cancer for Hispanics, fighting obesity and promoting health of minorities at workplace.\nHis main methodology research is in the construction of model- based optimal experimental designs for various biostatistical applications.\nHis recent interests are in the applications of nature-inspired metaheuristics to tackle challenging estimation and design problems in toxicology, clinical trials and other areas of statistics.\nHe has delivered more than 250 presentations globally, including recent short courses in design at Seoul National University and at the Toxicology Center in TU Dortmund University in Germany. Professor Wong has received grant awards from NSF and private foundations, along with several R01 grant awards from NIH as a principal investigator.\nHe is fellow of the American Statistical Association, the Institute of Mathematical Statistics,\nthe\nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science, an elected member of the International Statistical Institute and a full member of the Sigma Xi \u2013 The Scientific Research Honor Society.

        "abstract": "Computational difficulty of quadratic matching and the Gromov-Wasserstein distance has led to various approximation and relaxation schemes. One of such methods, relying on the notion of distance profiles, has been widely used in practice, but its theoretical understanding is limited. By delving into the statistical complexity of the previously proposed method based on distance profiles, we show that it suffers from the curse of dimensionality unless we make certain assumptions on the underlying metric measure spaces. Building on this insight, we propose and analyze a modified matching procedure that can be used to robustly match points under a certain probabilistic setting. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods using simulations and real data applications to complement the theoretical findings. As a result, we contribute to the literature by providing theoretical underpinnings of the matching procedures based on distance invariants like distance profiles, which have been widely used in practice but rarely analyzed theoretically.",

        "abstract": "Imagine an investor who owns a stock that he wishes to sell so as to maximize his return and minimize his risk upon selling. In line with the classic mean-variance analysis, we identify the return with the expectation of the stock price and the risk with the variance of the stock price.\nThe quadratic nonlinearity of the variance then moves the resulting optimal stopping problem outside the scope of the standard/linear optimal stopping theory. Consequently, the results and methods of the standard/linear optimal stopping theory are no longer applicable in this new/nonlinear setting.\nThe solution to the nonlinear problem when the horizon is infinite has been known for some time, however, the method of proof used to solve the nonlinear problem in that case is not applicable in the case when the horizon is finite. The purpose of the talk is to present a new method of proof which solves the nonlinear problem when the horizon is finite. [This is joint work with P. Johnson and J.L. Pedersen]",
