        "abstract": "Computational difficulty of quadratic matching and the Gromov-Wasserstein distance has led to various approximation and relaxation schemes. One of such methods, relying on the notion of distance profiles, has been widely used in practice, but its theoretical understanding is limited. By delving into the statistical complexity of the previously proposed method based on distance profiles, we show that it suffers from the curse of dimensionality unless we make certain assumptions on the underlying metric measure spaces. Building on this insight, we propose and analyze a modified matching procedure that can be used to robustly match points under a certain probabilistic setting. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods using simulations and real data applications to complement the theoretical findings. As a result, we contribute to the literature by providing theoretical underpinnings of the matching procedures based on distance invariants like distance profiles, which have been widely used in practice but rarely analyzed theoretically.",

        "abstract": "We propose a framework to construct practical kernel-based two-sample tests from the family of f-divergences. The test statistic is computed from the witness function of a regularized variational representation of the divergence, which we estimate using kernel methods. The proposed test is adaptive over hyperparameters such as the kernel bandwidth and the regularization parameter. We provide theoretical guarantees for statistical test power across our family of f-divergence estimates. While our test covers a variety of f-divergences, we bring particular focus to the Hockey-Stick divergence, motivated by its applications to differential privacy auditing and machine unlearning evaluation. For two-sample testing, experiments demonstrate that different f-divergences are sensitive to different localized differences, illustrating the importance of leveraging diverse statistics. For machine unlearning, we propose a relative test that distinguishes true unlearning failures from safe distributional variations.",

Despite recent growth in both, causal evidence linking them is scarce. We use proprietary data on data center locations and a novel shift-share approach to provide the first estimates of effects on residential electricity prices in the United States. Surprisingly, we find that an additional data center decreases same-year prices, and these effects persist for a few years. However, higher dependence on renewable energy is associated with price increases from data centers. Our results provide initial causal evidence while highlighting open questions about long-term market dynamics with artificial intelligence and the role of energy composition",

        "abstract": "In the US, work opportunities for those with lower levels of formal education have moved in recent years toward service employment, and this concentration is especially strong among households with children. Even compared to other jobs for those without college degrees, service work is characterized by shorter tenure and less access to full-time hours, patterns that are visible in national data and are more pronounced for those with children. In novel data collected through daily text-message reports from hourly service workers with young children, we document additional patterns of volatility that have not previously been visible: in particular, both volatility in total hours worked per day and week and volatility in which hours of the day and week are worked. We show that this volatility requires workers aiming to maximize their earnings to set aside many more hours for work than they are actually paid for, interfering with other life responsibilities and the ability to supplement earnings with a second job.\u00a0 We develop novel metrics to capture these forms of volatility and to describe their sources. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for both means-tested programs and earnings-linked tax credits, the two major forms of income support provided by the federal government to families with children.",
