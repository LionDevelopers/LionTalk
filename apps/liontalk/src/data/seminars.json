        "abstract": "Imagine an investor who owns a stock that he wishes to sell so as to maximize his return and minimize his risk upon selling. In line with the classic mean-variance analysis, we identify the return with the expectation of the stock price and the risk with the variance of the stock price. The quadratic nonlinearity of the variance then moves the resulting optimal stopping problem outside the scope of the standard/linear optimal stopping theory. Consequently, the results and methods of the standard/linear optimal stopping theory are no longer applicable in this new/nonlinear setting. The solution to the nonlinear problem when the horizon is infinite has been known for some time, however, the method of proof used to solve the nonlinear problem in that case is not applicable in the case when the horizon is finite. The purpose of the talk is to present a new method of proof which solves the nonlinear problem when the horizon is finite. [This is joint work with P. Johnson and J.L. Pedersen]",

Contemporary trade policy argues that domestic production capacity is essential for innovation and thus productivity growth. Using Compustat and USITC data, we document tariff-induced shifts in R&D. Preliminary modelling features lower import tariffs raising output by reducing input prices but eroding profits of domestic varieties via business stealing. Firms then underinvest in implementation capital and design creation, reducing the variety of home inputs and slowing learning-by-doing. A planner internalizes the knowledge externality, implying dynamic gains from temporarily higher protection.",

        "abstract": "We analyze how firms should design wage contracts when workers collaborate in teams and effort costs depend on colleagues through a peer network. Performance-based compensation generates incentives that cascade through the organization, which firms target to boost profits. We analyze optimal incentive design if firms can\u2014and can\u2019t\u2014fully discriminate across workers, and when the production technology is separable or complementary across divisions. When workers\u2019 effort is substitutable, the most central workers\u2014those who influence most colleagues directly and indirectly\u2014receive the steepest incentives only when output risk is sufficiently large; otherwise firms prioritize workers that are closer to those they influence. We derive a sufficient network statistic that measures the surplus loss when firms must compensate workers of varying centrality equally. Finally, when production technology exhibits complementarity across teams, stronger incentives are assigned to workers who influence colleagues in small teams that receive little influence from others. We apply our findings to organizational design questions, such as optimal firm structure and workforce investments.",
