        "abstract": "Algorithmic stability is a central concept in statistics and learning theory that measures how sensitive an algorithm's output is to small changes in the training data. In this talk, we consider two different perspectives of algorithmic stability in statistical inference. In the first part, we investigate the problem of distribution-free algorithm risk evaluation, uncovering fundamental limitations for answering these questions with limited amounts of data. To navigate the challenge, we will discuss how incorporating an assumption about algorithmic stability might help. In this second part, we reveal that while stability entails desirable properties, it is typically not sufficient on its own for statistical learning. For example, an algorithm that always outputs a constant function is perfectly stable but statistically meaningless. Then we will discuss the trade-offs between stability and accuracy in statistical inference.",

Interestingly, metaheuristics seem to be still relatively underused in the statistical research community. I present an overview of nature-inspired metaheuristics and describe their main appealing features, which are their speed, flexibility, availability of codes in different platforms, and ease of implementation and usage. Above all, they are virtually assumption-free, enabling us to apply these general-purpose algorithms to tackle all kinds of high-dimensional optimization tasks. I will highlight recent applications of these algorithms to find theory-based early-phase clinical trials, that are more realistic and flexible than current designs. If time permits, I will use an exemplary nature-inspired algorithm, called Particle Swarm Optimization and demonstrate how it quickly finds an optimal design for estimating a dose that optimizes a clinical utility index under a Bivariate Emax Model.",

In this talk I will present recent work with Jiaheng Chen on learning elliptic PDOs from noisy data. Within a wavelet--Galerkin framework, we formulate this task as a structured infinite-dimensional regression problem with multiscale sparsity. Building on this structure, we propose a sparse, data- and computation-efficient estimator, which leverages a novel matrix compression scheme tailored to the learning task and a nested-support strategy to balance approximation and estimation errors. In addition to establishing convergence rates for the estimator, we show that the learned operator induces an efficient and stable Galerkin solver whose numerical error matches its statistical accuracy. Our results therefore contribute to bringing together operator learning, data-driven solvers, and wavelet methods in scientific computing.",

A central question is under which assumptions neural networks can circumvent the well-known curse of dimensionality. Existing literature typically addresses this question by either imposing structural assumptions on the target function or by assuming that the covariates possess a low-dimensional structure. In this talk, we present a unified framework that incorporates both types of assumptions within a single model. We show that neural networks can adapt to this framework and establish approximation and excess risk bounds that are independent of the ambient input dimension. Our results apply to simple fully connected neural networks with flexible width and depth. In the second part of the talk, we address the persistent gap between the statistical and optimization perspectives in deep learning. We present first results that jointly account for both aspects by deriving statistical risk bounds for estimators obtained via gradient descent. This talk is based on joint work with Alina Braun, Michael Kohler, Adam Krzyzak, and Thomas Nagler.",

One of such methods, relying on the notion of distance profiles, has been widely used in practice, but its theoretical understanding is limited. By delving into the statistical complexity of the previously proposed method based on distance profiles, we show that it suffers from the curse of dimensionality unless we make certain assumptions on the underlying metric measure spaces. Building on this insight, we propose and analyze a modified matching procedure that can be used to robustly match points under a certain probabilistic setting. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods using simulations and real data applications to complement the theoretical findings. As a result, we contribute to the literature by providing theoretical underpinnings of the matching procedures based on distance invariants like distance profiles, which have been widely used in practice but rarely analyzed theoretically.",

We provide theoretical guarantees for statistical test power across our family of f-divergence estimates. While our test covers a variety of f-divergences, we bring particular focus to the Hockey-Stick divergence, motivated by its applications to differential privacy auditing and machine unlearning evaluation. For two-sample testing, experiments demonstrate that different f-divergences are sensitive to different localized differences, illustrating the importance of leveraging diverse statistics. For machine unlearning, we propose a relative test that distinguishes true unlearning failures from safe distributional variations.",

We address these challenges with a comprehensive framework combining novel training and post-processing techniques, and a model distillation procedure that leverages the strengths of these techniques to produce a more efficient and effective pose estimator. Our multi-view transformer (MVT) utilizes pretrained backbones and enables simultaneous processing of information across all views, while a novel patch masking scheme learns robust cross-view correspondences without camera calibration. For calibrated setups, we incorporate geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and a triangulation loss. We extend the existing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor to the nonlinear case and enhance uncertainty quantification via a variance inflation technique. Finally, to leverage the scaling properties of the MVT, we design a distillation procedure that exploits improved EKS predictions and uncertainty estimates to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby reducing dependence on manual labels. Our framework components consistently outperform existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees), with each component contributing complementary benefits. The result is a practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.",

However, the majority of patients demonstrate primary or secondary resistance to these drugs. Insight into the mechanisms of action of ICI and into resistance mechanisms is required in order to improve on these results. Our lab, as well as other labs have identified B cells and plasma cells as major participants in the response to ICI. Spatial proteomics of NSCLC specimens and additional studies demonstrate early activated B cells, as well as activated memory T-cells to be involved in this response, mostly within tertiary lymphoid structures. Using single-cell RNA and B cell receptor sequencing we have identified clonal expansion of specific B-cell subtypes. To conclude, the response to ICI involves coordinated T-cell as well as B-cell activation, suggesting novel therapeutic targets.\nHosted by\nDr. Brian Henick.",

How can it bring us closer to understanding biology, the functions of our cells and relationships across different molecular layers? In this talk, I will introduce generative AI methods designed to uncover relationships across different omics layers.

My work has pioneered the novel concepts of linking genetic ancestry, the only biological link that traverses the African diaspora, to the cause of aggressive tumor phenotypes, which cause disparate burden in already underserved populations across the world. My global oncology approach has uncovered unique biological traits of tumor progression that provides insight to treatment and prevention strategies, to be tailored into precision medicine tools.\nJoin Zoom Meeting\nhttps://columbiacuimc.zoom.us/j/93269055670?pwd=RiA2n0N1EjW9B3GeaifF461bdbOLdE.1\nMeeting ID: 932 6905 5670\nPasscode: 546000\n---\nOne tap mobile\n+13092053325,,93269055670#\nUS\n+13126266799,,93269055670#\nUS (Chicago)",

        "abstract": "While current economic theory focuses on prices and games, this book models economic settings where harmony is established through one of the following societal conventions: -A power relation according to which stronger agents are able to force weaker ones to do things against their will. -A norm that categorizes actions as permissible or forbidden. -A status relation over alternatives which limits each agent\u2019s choices. -Systematic biases in agents\u2019 preferences. These four conventions are analysed using simple and mathematically straightforward models, without any pretensions regarding direct applied usefulness. While we do not advocate for the adoption of any of these conventions specifically \u2013 we do advocate that when modelling an economic situation, alternative equilibrium notions should be considered, rather than automatically reaching for the familiar approaches of prices or games.",

        "abstract": "Exposure to heat is a workplace disamenity expected to worsen with climate change. Yet, because heat simultaneously reduces worker productivity, wages do not necessarily increase with exposure. Instead, the relative impact of amenity and productivity shocks on wages is mediated by the structure of worker-firm matching. We study the wage returns to heat exposure in the US labor market, highlighting the contribution of these two channels, the role of occupational sorting, and the influence of immigration policy in shaping this sorting. Empirically, citizenship status strongly predicts heat exposure. We also show that the share of non-citizen workers in exposed occupations rises with heat shocks, and that the tightening of immigration enforcement during the Secure Communities program significantly reduced compensation for heat. To quantify these mechanisms, we estimate a two-sided matching model where firms exercise differentiated monopsony power over citizen and non-citizen workers. Counterfactual simulations suggest that future climate-driven temperature shifts will induce labor resorting and lower the average wage returns to heat.",
