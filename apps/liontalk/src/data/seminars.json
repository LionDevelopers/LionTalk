        "abstract": "Algorithmic stability is a central concept in statistics and learning theory that measures how sensitive an algorithm's output is to small changes in the training data. In this talk, we consider two different perspectives of algorithmic stability in statistical inference. In the first part, we investigate the problem of distribution-free algorithm risk evaluation, uncovering fundamental limitations for answering these questions with limited amounts of data. To navigate the challenge, we will discuss how incorporating an assumption about algorithmic stability might help. In this second part, we reveal that while stability entails desirable properties, it is typically not sufficient on its own for statistical learning. For example, an algorithm that always outputs a constant function is perfectly stable but statistically meaningless. Then we will discuss the trade-offs between stability and accuracy in statistical inference.",

Interestingly, metaheuristics seem to be still relatively underused in the statistical research community. I present an overview of nature-inspired metaheuristics and describe their main appealing features, which are their speed, flexibility, availability of codes in different platforms, and ease of implementation and usage. Above all, they are virtually assumption-free, enabling us to apply these general-purpose algorithms to tackle all kinds of high-dimensional optimization tasks. I will highlight recent applications of these algorithms to find theory-based early-phase clinical trials, that are more realistic and flexible than current designs. If time permits, I will use an exemplary nature-inspired algorithm, called Particle Swarm Optimization and demonstrate how it quickly finds an optimal design for estimating a dose that optimizes a clinical utility index under a Bivariate Emax Model.

In this talk I will present recent work with Jiaheng Chen on learning elliptic PDOs from noisy data. Within a wavelet--Galerkin framework, we formulate this task as a structured infinite-dimensional regression problem with multiscale sparsity. Building on this structure, we propose a sparse, data- and computation-efficient estimator, which leverages a novel matrix compression scheme tailored to the learning task and a nested-support strategy to balance approximation and estimation errors. In addition to establishing convergence rates for the estimator, we show that the learned operator induces an efficient and stable Galerkin solver whose numerical error matches its statistical accuracy. Our results therefore contribute to bringing together operator learning, data-driven solvers, and wavelet methods in scientific computing.",

        "abstract": "Statistical learning theory for deep learning has primarily focused on analyzing neural networks as estimators in nonparametric regression and classification problems. A central question is under which assumptions neural networks can circumvent the well-known curse of dimensionality. Existing literature typically addresses this question by either imposing structural assumptions on the target function or by assuming that the covariates possess a low-dimensional structure. In this talk, we present a unified framework that incorporates both types of assumptions within a single model. We show that neural networks can adapt to this framework and establish approximation and excess risk bounds that are independent of the ambient input dimension. Our results apply to simple fully connected neural networks with flexible width and depth. In the second part of the talk, we address the persistent gap between the statistical and optimization perspectives in deep learning. We present first results that jointly account for both aspects by deriving statistical risk bounds for estimators obtained via gradient descent. This talk is based on joint work with Alina Braun, Michael Kohler, Adam Krzyzak, and Thomas Nagler.",

In line with the classic mean-variance analysis, we identify the return with the expectation of the stock price and the risk with the variance of the stock price.\nThe quadratic nonlinearity of the variance then moves the resulting optimal stopping problem outside the scope of the standard/linear optimal stopping theory. Consequently, the results and methods of the standard/linear optimal stopping theory are no longer applicable in this new/nonlinear setting.\nThe solution to the nonlinear problem when the horizon is infinite has been known for some time, however, the method of proof used to solve the nonlinear problem in that case is not applicable in the case when the horizon is finite. The purpose of the talk is to present a new method of proof which solves the nonlinear problem when the horizon is finite. [This is joint work with P. Johnson and J.L. Pedersen]",

We then study the limiting behavior of the particle systems, establishing the continuous dependence of the joint law of the physical solution on the underlying graph structure with respect to local convergence and showing the convergence of the global empirical measure, which extends the general results by Lacker et al. to systems with singular interaction. The model proposed provides a general framework for analyzing systemic risks in large sparsely connected financial networks with a focus on local interactions, featuring instantaneous default cascades.
