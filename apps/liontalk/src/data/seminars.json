        "abstract": "Algorithmic stability is a central concept in statistics and learning theory that measures how sensitive an algorithm's output is to small changes in the training data. In this talk, we consider two different perspectives of algorithmic stability in statistical inference. In the first part, we investigate the problem of distribution-free algorithm risk evaluation, uncovering fundamental limitations for answering these questions with limited amounts of data. To navigate the challenge, we will discuss how incorporating an assumption about algorithmic stability might help. In this second part, we reveal that while stability entails desirable properties, it is typically not sufficient on its own for statistical learning. For example, an algorithm that always outputs a constant function is perfectly stable but statistically meaningless. Then we will discuss the trade-offs between stability and accuracy in statistical inference.",

Interestingly, metaheuristics seem to be still relatively underused in the statistical research community. I present an overview of nature-inspired metaheuristics and describe their main appealing features, which are their speed, flexibility, availability of codes in different platforms, and ease of implementation and usage.\nAbove all, they are virtually assumption-free, enabling us to apply these general-purpose algorithms to tackle all kinds of high-dimensional optimization tasks. I will highlight recent applications of these algorithms to find theory-based early-phase clinical trials, that are more realistic and flexible than current designs.\nIf time permits, I will use an exemplary nature-inspired algorithm, called Particle Swarm Optimization and demonstrate how it quickly finds an optimal design for estimating a dose that optimizes a clinical utility index under a Bivariate Emax Model.\nKeywords: Continuous Designs, Early Phase Trials, Equivalence Theorems,\nOptimal Experiment Designs, Particle Swarm Optimization.",

In this talk I will present recent work with Jiaheng Chen on learning elliptic PDOs from noisy data. Within a wavelet--Galerkin framework, we formulate this task as a structured infinite-dimensional regression problem with multiscale sparsity. Building on this structure, we propose a sparse, data- and computation-efficient estimator, which leverages a novel matrix compression scheme tailored to the learning task and a nested-support strategy to balance approximation and estimation errors. In addition to establishing convergence rates for the estimator, we show that the learned operator induces an efficient and stable Galerkin solver whose numerical error matches its statistical accuracy. Our results therefore contribute to bringing together operator learning, data-driven solvers, and wavelet methods in scientific computing.",

One of such methods, relying on the notion of distance profiles, has been widely used in practice, but its theoretical understanding is limited. By delving into the statistical complexity of the previously proposed method based on distance profiles, we show that it suffers from the curse of dimensionality unless we make certain assumptions on the underlying metric measure spaces. Building on this insight, we propose and analyze a modified matching procedure that can be used to robustly match points under a certain probabilistic setting. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods using simulations and real data applications to complement the theoretical findings. As a result, we contribute to the literature by providing theoretical underpinnings of the matching procedures based on distance invariants like distance profiles, which have been widely used in practice but rarely analyzed theoretically.",

The test statistic is computed from the witness function of a regularized variational representation of the divergence, which we estimate using kernel methods. The proposed test is adaptive over hyperparameters such as the kernel bandwidth and the regularization parameter. We provide theoretical guarantees for statistical test power across our family of f-divergence estimates. While our test covers a variety of f-divergences, we bring particular focus to the Hockey-Stick divergence, motivated by its applications to differential privacy auditing and machine unlearning evaluation. For two-sample testing, experiments demonstrate that different f-divergences are sensitive to different localized differences, illustrating the importance of leveraging diverse statistics. For machine unlearning, we propose a relative test that distinguishes true unlearning failures from safe distributional variations.",

In line with the classic mean-variance analysis, we identify the return with the expectation of the stock price and the risk with the variance of the stock price.\nThe quadratic nonlinearity of the variance then moves the resulting optimal stopping problem outside the scope of the standard/linear optimal stopping theory. Consequently, the results and methods of the standard/linear optimal stopping theory are no longer applicable in this new/nonlinear setting.\nThe solution to the nonlinear problem when the horizon is infinite has been known for some time, however, the method of proof used to solve the nonlinear problem in that case is not applicable in the case when the horizon is finite. The purpose of the talk is to present a new method of proof which solves the nonlinear problem when the horizon is finite. [This is joint work with P. Johnson and J.L. Pedersen]",

We then study the limiting behavior of the particle systems, establishing the continuous dependence of the joint law of the physical solution on the underlying graph structure with respect to local convergence and showing the convergence of the global empirical measure, which extends the general results by Lacker et al. to systems with singular interaction. The model proposed provides a general framework for analyzing systemic risks in large sparsely connected financial networks with a focus on local interactions, featuring instantaneous default cascades.

        "abstract": "We study how voters process information through two experiments around Indian elections. In a large-scale experiment, we show that providing voters information about candidates\u2019 criminal charges increases votes for clean candidates and reduces votes for criminal politicians, with larger penalties for candidates facing more and serious charges. A follow-up experiment replicates these results and identifies two mechanisms. First, information facilitates learning: voters form more accurate beliefs and evaluate criminal candidates less favorably. Second, using direct measures of voter attention, we show that information makes criminality more salient\u2014especially when it is surprising or highlights contrast\u2014and increases its weight in voting decisions. Our findings demonstrate that information can improve political selection in polarized environments by helping voters learn about, and drawing their attention to, valence qualities.",
