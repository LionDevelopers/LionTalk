        "abstract": "Algorithmic stability is a central concept in statistics and learning theory that measures how sensitive an algorithm's output is to small changes in the training data. In this talk, we consider two different perspectives of algorithmic stability in statistical inference. In the first part, we investigate the problem of distribution-free algorithm risk evaluation, uncovering fundamental limitations for answering these questions with limited amounts of data. To navigate the challenge, we will discuss how incorporating an assumption about algorithmic stability might help. In this second part, we reveal that while stability entails desirable properties, it is typically not sufficient on its own for statistical learning. For example, an algorithm that always outputs a constant function is perfectly stable but statistically meaningless. Then we will discuss the trade-offs between stability and accuracy in statistical inference.",

Interestingly, metaheuristics seem to be still relatively underused in the statistical research community. I present an overview of nature-inspired metaheuristics and describe their main appealing features, which are their speed, flexibility, availability of codes in different platforms, and ease of implementation and usage.\nAbove all, they are virtually assumption-free, enabling us to apply these general-purpose algorithms to tackle all kinds of high-dimensional optimization tasks. I will highlight recent applications of these algorithms to find theory-based early-phase clinical trials, that are more realistic and flexible than current designs.\nIf time permits, I will use an exemplary nature-inspired algorithm, called Particle Swarm Optimization and demonstrate how it quickly finds an optimal design for estimating a dose that optimizes a clinical utility index under a Bivariate Emax Model.\nKeywords: Continuous Designs, Early Phase Trials, Equivalence Theorems,\nOptimal Experiment Designs, Particle Swarm Optimization.",

In this talk I will present recent work with Jiaheng Chen on learning elliptic PDOs from noisy data. Within a wavelet--Galerkin framework, we formulate this task as a structured infinite-dimensional regression problem with multiscale sparsity. Building on this structure, we propose a sparse, data- and computation-efficient estimator, which leverages a novel matrix compression scheme tailored to the learning task and a nested-support strategy to balance approximation and estimation errors. In addition to establishing convergence rates for the estimator, we show that the learned operator induces an efficient and stable Galerkin solver whose numerical error matches its statistical accuracy. Our results therefore contribute to bringing together operator learning, data-driven solvers, and wavelet methods in scientific computing.",

A central question is under which assumptions neural networks can circumvent the well-known curse of dimensionality. Existing literature typically addresses this question by either imposing structural assumptions on the target function or by assuming that the covariates possess a low-dimensional structure.\nIn this talk, we present a unified framework that incorporates both types of assumptions within a single model. We show that neural networks can adapt to this framework and establish approximation and excess risk bounds that are independent of the ambient input dimension. Our results apply to simple fully connected neural networks with flexible width and depth.\nIn the second part of the talk, we address the persistent gap between the statistical and optimization perspectives in deep learning. We present first results that jointly account for both aspects by deriving statistical risk bounds for estimators obtained via gradient descent.\nThis talk is based on joint work with Alina Braun, Michael Kohler, Adam Krzyzak, and Thomas Nagler.",

        "abstract": "This talk reviews a theory of the functions learned by ReLU neural networks. At its core is the observation that deep ReLU networks can be characterized as solutions to data-fitting problems in certain infinite dimensional function spaces. The solutions are compositions of functions from Banach spaces of second-order bounded variation, defined in the Radon transform domain. Functions in these spaces exhibit strong smoothness in most directions, making it a natural setting for adapting to intrinsic low-dimensional structure in data. Moreover, the norms in these spaces are closely tied to the size of neural network weights, providing a direct connection between function complexity and network parametrization. In particular, the total variation norm provides an analytic tool for identifying functions that cannot be realized by shallow networks, thereby yielding a precise characterization of depth separation. Representer theorems reveal the solutions are sparse in the number of active neurons per layer. Sparsity provides a principled path to network compression, yet some sparse solutions can suffer from poor generalization. The theory suggests new training strategies to promote solutions that generalize more robustly. Beyond these theoretical contributions, the framework also informs the design of implicit neural representations, where multi-layer networks represent continuous signals, images, and 3D scenes. In this setting, the theory points to improved strategies for training, hyperparameter selection, and architecture design.\nParhi, R., & Nowak, R. D. (2026).

One of such methods, relying on the notion of distance profiles, has been widely used in practice, but its theoretical understanding is limited. By delving into the statistical complexity of the previously proposed method based on distance profiles, we show that it suffers from the curse of dimensionality unless we make certain assumptions on the underlying metric measure spaces. Building on this insight, we propose and analyze a modified matching procedure that can be used to robustly match points under a certain probabilistic setting. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods using simulations and real data applications to complement the theoretical findings. As a result, we contribute to the literature by providing theoretical underpinnings of the matching procedures based on distance invariants like distance profiles, which have been widely used in practice but rarely analyzed theoretically.",

We provide theoretical guarantees for statistical test power across our family of f-divergence estimates. While our test covers a variety of f-divergences, we bring particular focus to the Hockey-Stick divergence, motivated by its applications to differential privacy auditing and machine unlearning evaluation. For two-sample testing, experiments demonstrate that different f-divergences are sensitive to different localized differences, illustrating the importance of leveraging diverse statistics. For machine unlearning, we propose a relative test that distinguishes true unlearning failures from safe distributional variations.",

We address these challenges with a comprehensive framework combining novel training and post-processing techniques, and a model distillation procedure that leverages the strengths of these techniques to produce a more efficient and effective pose estimator. Our multi-view transformer (MVT) utilizes pretrained backbones and enables simultaneous processing of information across all views, while a novel patch masking scheme learns robust cross-view correspondences without camera calibration. For calibrated setups, we incorporate geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and a triangulation loss. We extend the existing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor to the nonlinear case and enhance uncertainty quantification via a variance inflation technique. Finally, to leverage the scaling properties of the MVT, we design a distillation procedure that exploits improved EKS predictions and uncertainty estimates to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby reducing dependence on manual labels. Our framework components consistently outperform existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees), with each component contributing complementary benefits. The result is a practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.",

In line with the classic mean-variance analysis, we identify the return with the expectation of the stock price and the risk with the variance of the stock price. The quadratic nonlinearity of the variance then moves the resulting optimal stopping problem outside the scope of the standard/linear optimal stopping theory. Consequently, the results and methods of the standard/linear optimal stopping theory are no longer applicable in this new/nonlinear setting. The solution to the nonlinear problem when the horizon is infinite has been known for some time, however, the method of proof used to solve the nonlinear problem in that case is not applicable in the case when the horizon is finite.

Our approach is based on the construction of a Snell envelope under a sublinear expectation.

Our results encompass continuous processes or processes with jumps and non-vanishing diffusion. A key application is to financial market models, where uncertainty is quantified through the semi-martingale characteristics.",

First, we address systemic vulnerabilities in auctions, demonstrating how randomizing closing times and optimizing transaction fees can successfully mitigate the market-distorting price impact of strategic late arrivals (snipping). Shifting to the exchange's perspective, we then frame optimal rebate and fee policies as a continuous-time principal-multi-agent problem, utilizing the Deep BSDE method to design incentive structures that enhance market efficiency and narrow clearing price spreads. Finally, we adopt the market maker's perspective by introducing a Deep Q-Learning framework. Rather than relying on traditional terminal inventory penalties, this adaptive model explicitly anticipates the closing auction's liquidity, dynamically refining execution strategies to outperform classical benchmarks on both stochastic and historical data. Together, these frameworks offer a holistic approach to building and navigating more resilient financial markets. Based on joint works with Tianrui Xu and Julius Graf.",

However, the majority of patients demonstrate primary or secondary resistance to these drugs. Insight into the mechanisms of action of ICI and into resistance mechanisms is required in order to improve on these results. Our lab, as well as other labs have identified B cells and plasma cells as major participants in the response to ICI. Spatial proteomics of NSCLC specimens and additional studies demonstrate early activated B cells, as well as activated memory T-cells to be involved in this response, mostly within tertiary lymphoid structures. Using single-cell RNA and B cell receptor sequencing we have identified clonal expansion of specific B-cell subtypes. To conclude, the response to ICI involves coordinated T-cell as well as B-cell activation, suggesting novel therapeutic targets.\nHosted by\tDr. Brian Henick.",

At the heart of this revolution are generative AI models that, powered by advanced architectures and large datasets, are transforming AI across a variety of disciplines. But how can AI facilitate and eventually enable discoveries in life sciences? How can it bring us closer to understanding biology, the functions of our cells and relationships across different molecular layers? In this talk, I will introduce generative AI methods designed to uncover relationships across different omics layers. I will demonstrate how these approaches enable the reassembly of tissues from dissociated single cells and how they can help us to understand the relationship between cellular morphology and transcriptomic profiles. Finally, I will present an evaluation framework that disentangles perturbation-specific effects from systematic variation.",

        "abstract": "Exposure to heat is a workplace disamenity expected to worsen with climate change. Yet, because heat simultaneously reduces worker productivity, wages do not necessarily increase with exposure. Instead, the relative impact of amenity and productivity shocks on wages is mediated by the structure of worker-firm matching. We study the wage returns to heat exposure in the US labor market, highlighting the contribution of these two channels, the role of occupational sorting, and the influence of immigration policy in shaping this sorting. Empirically, citizenship status strongly predicts heat exposure. We also show that the share of non-citizen workers in exposed occupations rises with heat shocks, and that the tightening of immigration enforcement during the Secure Communities program significantly reduced compensation for heat. To quantify these mechanisms, we estimate a two-sided matching model where firms exercise differentiated monopsony power over citizen and non-citizen workers. Counterfactual simulations suggest that future climate-driven temperature shifts will induce labor resorting and lower the average wage returns to heat.",
